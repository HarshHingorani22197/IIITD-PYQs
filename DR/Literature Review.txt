1. QuILT Tutorial
Paper Title: Investigating and Improving Student Understanding of the Basics of Quantum Computing
Abstract (Short Summary):
This paper discusses the creation and validation of a Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorial (QuILT) aimed at improving studentsâ€™ understanding of quantum computing basics like single-qubit systems, multi-qubit systems, and quantum gates.

The tutorial used inquiry-based learning methods.

Students initially had major misconceptions after lectures alone.

Using QuILT helped students significantly improve their conceptual understanding.

Focused on scaffolding student learning using cognitive task analysis.

2. VR Wave-Particle Duality
Paper Title: Application of Virtual Reality in Learning Quantum Mechanics
Abstract (Short Summary):
This study explored using Virtual Reality to teach waveâ€“particle duality.

VR modules let students interactively "see" quantum phenomena like electron and photon behavior.

Compared to textbook learning, VR learners showed higher understanding, higher motivation, and lower cognitive load.

VR made abstract quantum concepts easier to grasp for high school students.
